# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 19, 2026

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how **Pokedex** ("the App", "we", "us", or "our") handles information when you use our mobile application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

## Information We Collect

### Personal Data

**We do not collect any personal data.** The App does not require you to create an account, provide your name, email, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information.

### Usage Data

**We do not collect usage data.** The App does not use analytics services, crash reporting tools, or any form of tracking.

### Device Data

**We do not collect device data.** The App does not access or transmit any information about your device.

## Data Stored Locally on Your Device

The App stores the following data locally on your device using a local database. This data **never leaves your device** and is **not accessible to us**:

- **Pokemon cache:** Information fetched from the PokeAPI (names, stats, images, etc.) is cached locally to improve performance and allow offline access.
- **Favorites:** Your favorited Pokemon selections are saved locally on your device.

This local data can be deleted at any time by clearing the App's data or uninstalling the App.

## Third-Party Services

The App connects to the following external service:

- **PokeAPI (pokeapi.co):** The App fetches Pokemon data (names, images, stats, moves, evolutions, types) from the public PokeAPI v2. This is a free, open-source RESTful API. When the App makes requests to PokeAPI, your device's IP address is transmitted as part of the standard HTTP connection. We have no control over how PokeAPI handles this data. You can review their privacy practices at [https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2).

- **Raw GitHub User Content (raw.githubusercontent.com):** The App loads Pokemon images from this hosting service. Your device's IP address is transmitted as part of the standard HTTP connection.

**We do not use any advertising services, analytics platforms, or social media SDKs.**

## Children's Privacy

The App does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Since no data is collected, the App complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar regulations.

## Permissions

The App requires the following permission:

- **Internet Access:** Required to fetch Pokemon data from PokeAPI and load Pokemon images. No data is sent from your device to our servers, as we do not operate any servers.

## Data Security

Since we do not collect or transmit any personal data, there is no personal data at risk. All data stored by the App remains on your device and is protected by your device's built-in security features.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this document. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
